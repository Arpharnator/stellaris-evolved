 distar.170.desc.tec_pu_neuroslug:0 "The [Root.GetName] crew have made some astonishing discoveries on [From.GetName]. The abandoned primitive settlements first seen from orbit were once inhabited by a society of reptiles that still populate the planet - but have since lost all capacity for sapient thought! In investigating how these creatures devolved from a tool-making agrarian society into mere beasts, [Root.GetLeaderName] made an unexpected find.\n\nThe burial remains of the settlement-dwelling reptiles possess a spinocranial organ not observed among their now-bestial counterparts. Testing has revealed these organs to be another species entirely - a sort of neural symbiont like the one we possess that connects with the host's brain stem via external attachment to the spine. These symbionts can still be found in hotsprings on the planet's surface. It seems the union between the two species triggered the temporary uplift of the reptiles, in a similar way that happened with our own symbiotes.\n\nWhat later interrupted this symbiosis, however, remains unknown."
