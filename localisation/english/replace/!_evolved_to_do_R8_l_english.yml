	Astory.115.desc.phobe:0 "Several dead Amoebas later, we are able to investigate the Space Amoebas' grotesque relationship with the smaller creatures they house inside their bodies. As far as [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] xeno-biologists can tell, these flagella - named for their whip-like movements - are not proper offspring or even parasites. They are simply spawned from the host once the host reaches maturity, created as tools rather than the result of procreation. Once their task is complete they return to a pocket in the host Amoeba, seemingly to receive new orders. They work as manipulators, blind appendages reaching in the dark. The laughably obvious drawbacks resulting from their inherently delayed reaction time are somewhat offset by the Amoeba's sheer number of circulating flagella, and the individual flagellum's strong set of reflexive responses and ability to dumbly track the host Amoeba.\n\nAt any rate, we are better at killing them now."
	Astory.115.desc.milit:0 "With several carcasses collected, we are able to investigate the Space Amoebas' curious relationship with the smaller creatures they house inside their bodies. As far as [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] xeno-biologists can tell, these flagella - named for their whip-like movements - are not proper offspring or even parasites. They are simply spawned from the host once the host reaches maturity, created as tools rather than the result of procreation. Where one would expect to find a brain - considering their intricate movement and inter-flagellar interactions - the flagellum instead possess a complex glandular processing center. This center decodes input - orders - in the form of RNA, secreted by the Amoeba and received by the flagellum through subcutaneous receptors. Once their task is complete they return to a pocket in the host Amoeba to receive new orders. This allows them to work as manipulators, hands severed from the body. The obvious drawbacks in this inherently delayed reaction time are somewhat offset by the Amoeba's sheer number of circulating flagella, and the individual flagellum's strong set of reflexive responses and ability to dumbly track the host Amoeba. The Space Amoebas' relative proficiency in deep-space combat is largely due to the consistent deployment of their flagella, something our forces could likely learn a lot from."

We are now beginning to divine some of the creatures' hidden truths, and they are being conveyed to the appropriate departments within [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] administration.\n\nThe perhaps most useful discovery at present relates to the Space Amoebas' cutaneous membranes. They absorb and - through complex glandular processes - metabolize a wide range of cosmic radiation, seemingly drawing some sustenance from the rays."
