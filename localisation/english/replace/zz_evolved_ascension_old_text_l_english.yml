	#tec_gene_path.10075.desc:0 "Curiously, we tried applying certain electrochemical processes to expressive allelomorphs and it resulted in a curious breakthrough - The capacity of adaptation and integration of new code inside the existing one led to a potential controlled overload of genetic material.\nWith time and effort, this can allow a slightly higher integration of potential traits inside already crowded pairs."

	#tec_gene_path.10090.name:0 "Genetic Discovery"
	#tec_gene_path.10090.desc:0 "During one of the tests with our new discovered biotechnology, we found an... interesting anomaly - Some cells reacted to the malleability techniques, becoming semi-independent stem-cells able to not only recombine genetic material, but also create new expressions out if it.\nWhile we can continue forcing the allelomorphic change for streamlined genetic processes, we may be able to apply our efforts to the new hyper-cells, which can... change our entire perspective on genetics, biology and, perhaps, our species as a whole."
