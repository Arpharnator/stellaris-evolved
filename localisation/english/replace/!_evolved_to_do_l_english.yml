 START_SCREEN_TEC_BIOSHAPERS:0 "The different cultures of [GetHomeWorldName] soon realized that genetic manipulation was a way to improve their life, from selecting fruits to cattle, from creating strands to surviving pandemics and pest, or using them to their benefit.\nThat obsession with genetic perfection derived in a colossal science effort to apply that knowledge to science, to be able to create life, a perfect and servile life to serve their purpose.\nAfter centuries of development, they did it, crafting a new being from a native specie, a new obedient servant they could tailor from even before its existence, building it block from block, cell from cell.\n\nAs they bended and controlled our very life blocks, they will shape the universe with their might."
