 tec_song_events.2.name:0 "Arpeggio Solaris"
 tec_song_events.2.desc:0 "Shortly after deploying our new settlements at [root.GetName], we have detected a series of anomalies in our energy readings and long-range telecommunication inputs. We can't fully detect the source as this could be a sensor malfunction, regardless it would be advisable to look into this anomalous signal, as it could prose a danger to the colony, or our empire as a whole."
 tec_song_events.2.a:0 "Interesting, establish a listening point."
 tec_song_events.2.a.tooltip:0 "We will keep track of the §YSignal§!, while trying to locate and interpret its meaning."
 tec_song_events.2.b:0 "We don't have time for this."
 tec_song_events.2.b.tooltip:0 "Anything related to the signal will be §ROmitted§!."

 tec_song_events.3.name:0 "Eerie Silence"
 tec_song_events.3.desc:0 "The strange signal that bathed all our interception devices in short but incremental patterns is suddenly gone, which has caused perplexity in [root.GetName] listening point. The last records obtained indicated a king of exponential increase, which could reflect that maybe the nature of the signal is artificial, but we can't be sure until we can resample, study and translate it, so we will remain vigilant."
 tec_song_events.3.a:0 "We must be ready for the next opportunity."
 tec_song_events.3.a.tooltip:0 "A more in-depth §YStudy§! will be done when the signal appears again."

# Harmonization -------------------------------------------
 tec_song_events.5.name:0 "Signal Harmonization"
 tec_song_events.5.desc:0 "Surprisingly, the signal is now back, and it is again scaling in intensity; [tec_song_planet.GetName] communication systems are now fully dedicated to understand the content, intention and meaning of this anomaly."
 tec_song_events.5.a:0 "It must be deciphered."

 tec_song_events.7.name:0 "Empty Melody"
 tec_song_events.7.desc:0 "In what seems like a sudden change of the pace of transmission, the song signal started to weaken until it came to a stop. While spectral echoes remain for use and study, literally no new income or patterns are being received by our listening posts."
 tec_song_events.7.a.tooltip:0 "The rate of gaining §YSignal Harmonization§! will be severely §RReduced§!"

 tec_song_events.10.name:0 "From Nowhere"
 tec_song_events.10.desc:0 "After a safety period of listening, our understanding of this signal has increased. For now we can assume it doesn't presume any type of danger and, even if we can't figure the intention or cause of this phenomena, this supposes a big progress.\nWe can, however, double efforts with a project to decipher it further."
 tec_song_events.10.a:0 "Proceed with the project"
 tec_song_events.10.a.tooltip:0 "The special project §YDecrypting Patterns§! will be available. Completing this special project will increase the rate of gaining §YSignal Harmonization§!, without additional £energy£ Upkeep.\n§YAny active approach to this situation will stop providing Signal Harmonization until the project is completed.§!"

 tec_song_events.1001.name:0 "Decrypted Patterns"
 tec_song_events.1001.desc:0 "Thanks to our study of the signal transmission, amplification and pattern, we have earned valuable information about how it is distributed around the planet; even if we still don't know that much about it, it is a clear victory and will help further efforts."
 tec_song_events.1001.a:0 "Incredible!"
 tec_song_events.1001.a.tooltip:0 "The gain of §YSignal Harmonization§! has §GIncreased§!."

 tec_song_events.11.name:0 "Soft Melodies"
 tec_song_events.11.desc:0 "The intensity and frequency of emission of the signal has been altered. Or perhaps this is a change in how we understand it, or perhaps this is just all a coincidence, but some members of our team can affirm it follows the same structuring as a song or melody. "
 tec_song_events.11.desc.gestalt:0 "Our drones have detected a subtle alteration and the intensity and frequency of emission of the signal, but it is internally debated if somehow the very essence of the signal has created a false analysis of the outcome of it. Regardless, some autonomous drones confirm the signal is composed exclusively by music or melodic tones, others affirm the signal mimics our consciousness patterns, which is potentially worrying."
 tec_song_events.11.a:0 "Maybe we can take advantage of this."
 tec_song_events.11.a.tooltip:0 "Our empire will seek a way to benefit from this information."
 tec_song_events.11.b:0 "Continue a passive study."
 tec_song_events.11.b.tooltip:0 "The signal will be analyzed nominally."

 tec_song_events.12.name:0 "A Beautiful Ballade"
 tec_song_events.12.desc.regular:0 "The signal has ... changed, this time to a pattern that causes good sensations among our research crew; there is some kind of strange and understandable harmony in each note and sequence, and, while still impossible to fully replicate, seems familiar to each individual able to experience it."
 tec_song_events.12.desc.hive:0 "The signal has ... changed, this time to a pattern that resonates with our own thoughts, with our own collective; there is some kind of strange and understandable harmony in each note and sequence, and, while impossible to fully replicate by our drones, they are able to experiment a kind of ecstasy that feels new, but also familiar, to our very mind."
 tec_song_events.12.desc.machine:0 "The signal transmission has radically changed its pace. Our drones have interpreted this new alteration of the rhythm and pace as a new unique update, which surprisingly is close to our own queried protocols; the assigned drones which have reprocessed the routines included in the new signal iteration are experiencing a wave of ideas and innovative processes they have shared with the collective."
 tec_song_events.12.a.regular:0 "We should study how this could affect the colony"
 tec_song_events.12.a.regular.tooltip:0 "Our researchers will investigate a way to §YTest§! the signal effect on the colony in §Y30§! days."
 tec_song_events.12.a.megacorp:0 "Is there a way to benefit from this?"
 tec_song_events.12.a.megacorp.tooltip:0 "Our managers will investigate a way to §YObtain Profit§! from the signal effect on the colony in §Y30§! days."
 tec_song_events.12.a.gestalt:0 "We need to know how this could affect our drones."
 tec_song_events.12.a.gestalt.tooltip:0 "Our autonomous drones will investigate a way to §YStudy§! the impact of the signal effect on the colony in §Y30§! days."
 tec_song_events.12.b:0 "This is enough. Block the signal."
 tec_song_events.12.b.tooltip:0 "The special project §YSignal Blockade§! will be available. Completing this special project will §RPermanently§! block the signal.\n§YAny active approach to this situation will stop providing Signal Harmonization until the project is completed.§!"

 tec_song_events.13.name:0 "Diminuendo"
 tec_song_events.13.desc:0 "In a surprising twist, the signal has stopped reacting as it did before; instead of emitting regular waves it has started to diminish in small periods of successive reductions, not in intensity, but reception. Our estimations indicate a 75% of overall reduction if the repetitions continue.\nWe could try to do a final effort to keep the harmonization with the signal stable, but we can also decide that our time and efforts during all this time will be enough to reach the final answer we are searching for."
 tec_song_events.13.a:0 "Let's try it, it's the final countdown."
 tec_song_events.13.a.tooltip:0 "The special project §YThe Final Countdown§! will be available. Completing this special project will give us the final §GInsight§! on how the signal works.\n§YAny active approach to this situation will stop providing Signal Harmonization until the project is completed.§!"
 tec_song_events.13.b:0 "Let things go as they are..."
 tec_song_events.13.b.tooltip:0 "We will try to find out how the signal works without forcing it."

 tec_song_events.14.name:0 "Final Accord"
 tec_song_events.14.desc:0 "Just when the ''musical'' signal was reaching what we expected as the pinnacle of its transmission, when we were close to getting answers about it purpose and function, it ceased to exist; not even radio-spectral echoes or secondary cadences can be found anywhere, all we can detect now just answer us with cold, empty silence. At least we have regained enough data to replicate the signal for internal studies."
 tec_song_events.14.desc.reg:0 "$tec_song_events.14.desc$\nAnyway, some of our researchers theorize maybe interfering or attempting to understand the signal caused it to fade out, but that would be terrifying... as it would imply the signal itself may have some kind of consciousness or will."
 tec_song_events.14.desc.gestalt:0 "$tec_song_events.14.desc$\nSome of our autonomous drones theorize that maybe the signal itself detected our interest and found it not appropriated, but it cannot be confirmed by any mean. Regardless, such affirmation would mean the signal had any type of internal decision-making or will, which could had supposed a big interference in our long term plans."
 tec_song_events.14.a:0 "Maybe we should forget about this."
 tec_song_events.14.a.tooltip:0 "The signal seems to be gone, forever."

 tec_song_events.15.name:0 "Final Accord"
 tec_song_events.15.desc:0 "After all the time we invested into understanding the signal on [tec_song_planet.GetName], our [Owner.GetResearchers] have detected ... interesting events. Seems that the echo of our attempts to artificially replicate or tune more closely the signal triggered a kind of reproduction loop of the original one, and the mix of both signals became so intense planet-wide we were even able to locate a particular region of the planet where, apparently, both resonated with more energy, and we are sure we can find answers there.\nWhat we are certain is, right now, this can be our best bet to finally understand what, or who, has caused all this situation."
 tec_song_events.15.a:0 "Send a team immediately!"
 tec_song_events.15.a.tooltip:0 "The archeological site §Y$site_tec_song_jukebox$§! will appear at [tec_song_planet.GetName]."

 tec_song_events.1202.name:0 "Writing Our Own Score"
 tec_song_events.1202.desc.generic:0 "Our [Owner.GetResearchers] have retroactively studied the information we got of all the former signal transmission, that hasn't reappeared since we finished harmonizing our instrumental attempting to understand it: The information waves reaching [tec_song_planet.GetName] were a transmission containing and unknown and undecipherable message, and can be interpreted using musical and abstract knowledge."
 tec_song_events.1202.desc.regular:0 "$tec_song_events.1202.desc.generic$\nThe real issue comes when we attempt to recreate that melody with our equipment, which seems worthless, but we have reached the conclusion that each individual or susceptible subject can experience different forms of understanding it, with all coming to similar conclusions; this has leaded us to prepare a series of behavioral experiments which we can conduct in [tec_song_planet.GetName], attempting to reach the true depth of this issue."
 tec_song_events.1202.desc.megacorp:0 "$tec_song_events.1202.desc.generic$\nAs we haven't found a way to obtain profit from this, with any attempt to recreate the melody using our equipment being fruitless, we were contacted by a known artist in our empire to ''rent'' us a license of exploitation of such discovery by a large sum of credits, which can be also useful to us as social experiment on [tec_song_planet.GetName]."
 tec_song_events.1202.desc.gestalt:0 "$tec_song_events.1202.desc.generic$\nIn addition, some of our drones indicated the signal caused on them similar sensations as our collective thought, so after a period of introspection we came to a conclusion: If we want to reach the true meaning of all this, we should conduct some tests on [tec_song_planet.GetName] drones in order to attempt a replication of the aforementioned effects."
 tec_song_events.1202.a:0 "Do what is necessary"
 tec_song_events.1202.a.tooltip:0 "The special project §Y$TEC_SONG_PROJECT_REGULAR$§! will be available.

 site_tec_song_jukebox_intro:1 "Forcing an artificial version of the signal has caused a specific melodic cascade in an isolated region of [From.Planet.GetName]. Who knows what can be found there, but it's certain it will provide answers to the mystery we are experiencing."

 tec_song_events.1501.name:0 "What Only the Rocks Know"
 tec_song_events.1501.desc:1 "Spectrometers have guided the expedition towards a depth cavernous entrance to part of [From.Planet.GetName] Asthenosphere; Seems the source of the increased energy readings lead down the planet crust."
 tec_song_events.1501.a:0 "Proceed."

 tec_song_events.1502.name:0 "Notes in the stone"
 tec_song_events.1502.desc:0 "The travel towards the depth parts of the planet has been successful.\n\n[Leader.GetName] noticed strange carvings in the walls of surrounding cavities, as those were displayed in abnormally straight and well-sized transit spaces, like if the entire entrance was preemptively created, or had an intelligent design readings also indicate an intensification of the energy readings."
 tec_song_events.1502.a:0 "Intriguing, take notes."

 tec_song_events.1504.name:0 "Instrumental Underground"
 tec_song_events.1504.desc:0 "The next region on this underground labyrinth is filled of both sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, but the latter display an unusual pattern.\nNot only they seem to resonate with the signal, which is indication we are on a correct way, but they also manifest intense conductive properties, which we can employ for future uses."
 tec_song_events.1504.a:0 "We must be close."

 tec_song_events.1505.name:0 "Scale of Circumstances"
 tec_song_events.1505.desc:0 "The rocky cavern vibrates with intensity, and what lies in front of us will give answer to what we have been studying during all this time. The expedition leaded by [Leader.GetName] can't wait to finally end this mystery."
 tec_song_events.1505.a:0 "Lets discover the truth."

 tec_song_events.1511.desc:1 "The architectural and light spectacle presented after cleaning the cavity entrance was completely unexpected; The entire cave has an intricate system of ceramic pipes, instruments and gears working at unison, generating a constant and vivid vibration that can be felt through the entire place.\nThere is a lying beauty in this filigree of unknown author, but now we can both stare it its wonders and study who, why and when this was created."
 tec_song_events.1511.a:0 "An amazing discovery!"

 tec_song_events.1512.name:0 "Planetary Sonata"
 tec_song_events.1512.desc:1 "The opening leaded to an ample cavern filled by fluorescent flora and crystals, which resonate at unison, more even when we breached the rocky seal; a constant humming is present in the air, probably a byproduct of this activity... and the natural origin of this signal. This maybe poses more questions than answers, but maybe we can attempt to discover more."
 tec_song_events.1512.a:0 "Musical rocks? This is new."

 tec_song_events.1513.name:0 "Desperate Requiem"
 tec_song_events.1513.desc:1 "No one could prepare us to what [Leader.GetName] expedition found: A large spacecraft, buried for uncountable years, lies rusty and decayed in the interior of the cave, probably carved through thousands of natural hydric and sedimentary cycles around it, like a natural grave to the fallen object; some elements of the ship seems to still be active, or at least, small hums resonate and can be perceived as small vibrations in the air.\nWho or what came in this vehicle seems, tho, to be long gone, but we are now the new owners of this discovery."
 tec_song_events.1513.a:0 "Explore the area!"

# Endings
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Ending A - Song is created as artistic expression (good ending)
 tec_song_events.21.name:0 "Symphony of Memories"
 tec_song_events.21.desc:0 "After the initial batch of investigation, the expedition on [tec_song_planet.GetName] ended up finding that the signal is a kind of... sanctuary, or device, created with intricate and really well planned nano-ceramic inertia based mechanisms around the planet, which at least the cave we detected as one of the main ones.\nNow we have access to the source, it has been theorized this is some kind of artistic or geo-structural feat dedicated to amplify or preserve some kind of message, as the signal has proven to move feelings, memories and data all in one.\nMore investigations should be done on this regard, but now we have, at least, some answers."
 tec_song_events.21.a:0 "A beautiful feat of creation."
 tec_song_events.21.b:0 "We can use this technology to our advantage."
 tec_song_events.21.c:0 "Stop this now, dismantle the area."

# Ending B - Song is just a celestial coincidence (meh ending)

 tec_song_events.22.name:0 "Planetary Sonata"
 tec_song_events.22.desc:0 "After the initial batch of investigation, the expedition on [tec_song_planet.GetName] ended up finding that the signal is a byproduct of highly intense resonating crystals.\nThe crystals present under the surface of the planet manifest extremely conductive and permeating capacities, and as such, we theorize our mere presence and activity around the planet started a chain-reaction of amplified echoes around all the cave system, echoing our activities, transmissions and experiences.\nMore investigations should be done on this regard, and we have, at least, some answers."
 tec_song_events.22.a:0 "A coincidence, but we can learn out of it."
 tec_song_events.22.b:0 "Those crystals will be of use for sure!"

# Ending C - Song is a desperate SOS message ("bad" ending)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 tec_song_events.23.name:0 "Desperate Requiem"
 tec_song_events.23.desc:0 "After the initial batch of investigation, the expedition on [tec_song_planet.GetName] ended up finding what remains of a spacecraft long crashed in the planet, which also was the source of the eerie and mysterious signal we have been studying all these years.\nThe strange behavioral changes that signal produced are caused by the nature of the distress message this vassel was still emitting, reinforced by the nature of the planet, as it indicated both bio-markers and digi-markers on its waves, not only attempting to search for any king of aid, but also transmitting experiences, thoughts and... hope.\nMore investigations should be done on this regard, but anyway whoever created this message is now long gone, and we have, at least, some answers."
 tec_song_events.23.a:0 "Their memory won't be lost."
 tec_song_events.23.b:0 "This technology will serve us well."
