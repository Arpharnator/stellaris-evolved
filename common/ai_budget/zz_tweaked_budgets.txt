 # Note : weight is a % of 100 based around 1, so 0.3 is 33% of production, technically
 # Ai will theorically never build/use more than the fraction weight % of the total accumulated wealth
 # Static = max is the max used (static max base = 200 is for arcology project, in the case of influence)

	# Example: Organic hivemind wants to make a building costing 1000 food, has 100 monthly production and 2000 stored food
	# 			Unless the ai reaches a compfortable amount of stored food to allow that building to be made, it wont
	#			The amount is dictated by the fraction and weight modifier (0.3 weight = 30% of storage)
	#			So if the food is coded to have a weight of 0.3 for buildings in that case, the building will be made when 3k food are stored
