# tec_read_cache.txt
# This is a way of reading cached trigger values without doing scripted_trigger invocations
# This is used in most critical or repeated places ideally as it isn't the cleanest/clearest way of invoking it
# Places where i recommend use is in job inlines especially deeply nested ones, which mean some calls are repeated dozens of times.

# what this essentially does is has_<scope>_flag = tec_cache_<trigger>, eventually wrapping it if <redirect_scope> is passed
