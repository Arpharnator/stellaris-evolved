# species_trait_points: base number of species trait points available for this species class
# species_max_traits: maximum number of traits that species of this class can have (doesn't count those with cost == 0)

#EXAMPLE OF MODDED SPECIES ARCHETYPE
#Will be able to use traits valid for BIOLOGICAL, ROBOT and BIOLOGICAL2
#Has the exact same trait points as BIOLOGICAL
#BIOLOGICAL2 = {
#	inherit_trait_points_from = BIOLOGICAL
#	inherit_traits_from = { BIOLOGICAL ROBOT }
#}


# NOTE
# Seems inherit_trait_points overwrites both species_trait_points and species_max_traits 
# and disables the modifiers from being autogenerated/applying, need to test if they get generated
# and if so, we can apply the cyborg approach and apply the REPLICANT/BIOSERVANT specific ones
