# 	# List of valid mathematical operations:
# 	# 	Numerical (modifying by a number):
# 	# 	- set/weight (both do the same, replaces the current result with this value)
# 	# 	- add
# 	# 	- subtract
# 	# 	- factor/mult/multiply ("multiply" fits the name scheme of the rest better, but the other two were kept for historical reasons)
# 	# 	- divide
# 	# 	- modulo
# 	# 	- round_to (rounds to nearest of that value, e.g. 10.7 round_to 5 gives you 10)
# 	# 	- max (sets to specified value if currently above it)
# 	# 	- min (sets to specified value if currently below it)
# 	# 	Simple (do not need a number, but just "yes", e.g. "round = yes")
# 	# 	- round (sets to nearest full number)
# 	# 	- ceiling (rounds up)
# 	# 	- floor (rounds down)
# 	# 	- abs (multiply by -1 if negative)

# 	#All mathematical operations except weight and factor can be used inline e.g.
# 	add = 100
# 	multiply = value:some_other_script_value
# 	round = yes
# 	#(Note: weight and factor will instead overwrite the base value - use set, mult or multiply instead)

# 		max = owner.max_example_variable 					#Variable set by set_variable
# 		owner = { is_variable_set = max_example_variable }	#Only applied if this trigger is true

# 	# What works for right hand side values of mathematical operations? See events/00_how_to_use_variables for full list.

# 		trigger_scope = owner 		#Lets you get the result of the trigger on a different scope. Default is "this"

# }

# Final note: script_values use the same metascript system as scripted_triggers and scripted_effects
# This means that you can input parameters into them, in a similar fashion as described in scripted_effects/99_advanced_documentation.txt
# For format for doing so is value:my_value|PARAM1|value1|PARAM2|value2|.
# Then you can use $PARAM1$ in the script value and it will replace it with value1
